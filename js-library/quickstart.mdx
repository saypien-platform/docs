<Info>
  **Prerequisite** You should have basic knowledge of JavaScript and your
  website should be hosted on a platform like Vercel to load the library via a
  CDN.
</Info>

### Step 1.

Embed the Saypien JavaScript Library in your website.

<CodeGroup>

```html
<script src="https://saypien.io/plugins/saypien-survey.min.js"></script>
```

</CodeGroup>

### Step 2.

Add the JavaScript file to the `<HEAD>` section of your HTML file:

<CodeGroup>

```html index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Saypien Survey</title>
    <script src="https://saypien.io/plugins/saypien-survey.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Your content -->
  </body>
</html>
```

</CodeGroup>

### Step 3.

Initialize the library with a configuration:

<CodeGroup>

```html index.html
<script>
  window.SaypienSurvey.initialize({
    buttonId: "myButton", // Set to null if no button is used
    surveyId: "<YOUR_SURVEY_ID>", // Your specific survey ID
  });
</script>
```

</CodeGroup>

### Step 4.

Add a button that will trigger the overlay:

<CodeGroup>

```html index.html
<button id="myButton">Open Survey</button>
```

</CodeGroup>

The Saypien JavaScript Library is now integrated into your website, and you can customize it as needed.

### Configuration Options

The library can be configured with the following options:

- `buttonId` (Optional): The ID of the button that triggers the event listener. Set this to `null` if no button is used and the overlay should appear directly when the page loads.
- `surveyId` (Required): The survey ID used for the iFrame URL.
- `onComplete` (Optional): Callback function to be executed when the survey is completed.
- `onClose` (Optional): Callback function to be executed when the close button is clicked.
- `onOpen` (Optional): Callback function to be executed when the overlay is opened.
- `onStart` (Optional): Callback function to be executed when the survey is started.

### Example Configuration

Here is an example of a typical configuration:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript
window.SaypienSurvey.initialize({
  buttonId: "myButton", // Set to null if no button is used
  surveyId: "<YOUR_SURVEY_ID>", // Your specific survey ID
  onComplete: function () {
    console.log("Survey completed!");
  },
  onClose: function () {
    console.log("Survey closed!");
  },
  onOpen: function () {
    console.log("Survey opened!");
  },
  onStart: function () {
    console.log("Survey started!");
  },
});
```

</CodeGroup>

## Troubleshooting

Here's how to solve some common problems when integrating the Saypien JavaScript Library.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="The overlay is not displayed">
    Ensure that the `surveyId` is correctly provided and that the button with
    the specified `buttonId` exists.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="An error is displayed in the console">
    Check the configuration and make sure all required parameters are provided.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
