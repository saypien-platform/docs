<Info>
  **Note**: The Saypien JavaScript Library provides several event callbacks that
  you can use to execute custom functions at different stages of the survey
  lifecycle.
</Info>

## Available Event Callbacks

The Saypien JavaScript Library supports the following event callbacks:

- `onOpen`: Triggered when the overlay is opened.
- `onClose`: Triggered when the close button is clicked.
- `onStart`: Triggered when the survey is started.
- `onComplete`: Triggered when the survey is completed.

## Example Usage

Here is an example of how to use these event callbacks:

<CodeGroup>

```html index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Saypien Survey</title>
    <script src="https://saypien.io/plugins/saypien-survey.min.js"></script>
    <script>
      window.SaypienSurvey.initialize({
        buttonId: "myButton",
        surveyId: "<YOUR_SURVEY_ID>",
        onComplete: function () {
          alert("Thank you for completing the survey!");
        },
        onClose: function () {
          console.log("Survey closed by the user.");
        },
        onOpen: function () {
          console.log("Survey overlay opened.");
        },
        onStart: function () {
          console.log("Survey started.");
        },
      });
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to the Survey</h1>
    <button id="myButton">Open Survey</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

</CodeGroup>

## Detailed Explanation

### onComplete

The `onComplete` callback is executed when the survey is completed by the user. This is useful for performing actions such as showing a thank you message or redirecting the user to another page.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript index.js
window.SaypienSurvey.initialize({
  surveyId: "<YOUR_SURVEY_ID>",
  onComplete: function () {
    alert("Thank you for completing the survey!");
  },
});
```

</CodeGroup>

### onClose

The `onClose` callback is triggered when the user clicks the close button on the survey overlay. You can use this to log the event or to perform any cleanup actions.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript index.js
window.SaypienSurvey.initialize({
  surveyId: "<YOUR_SURVEY_ID>",
  onClose: function () {
    console.log("Survey closed by the user.");
  },
});
```

</CodeGroup>

### onOpen

The `onOpen` callback is executed when the survey overlay is opened. This can be useful for tracking the event or initializing certain states.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript index.js
window.SaypienSurvey.initialize({
  surveyId: "<YOUR_SURVEY_ID>",
  onOpen: function () {
    console.log("Survey overlay opened.");
  },
});
```

</CodeGroup>

### onStart

The `onStart` callback is triggered when the survey is started by the user. This can be useful for logging the start event or for analytics purposes.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript index.js
window.SaypienSurvey.initialize({
  surveyId: "<YOUR_SURVEY_ID>",
  onStart: function () {
    console.log("Survey started.");
  },
});
```

</CodeGroup>

## Combining Callbacks

You can combine multiple event callbacks to handle different events within the survey lifecycle.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript index.js
window.SaypienSurvey.initialize({
  surveyId: "<YOUR_SURVEY_ID>",
  onComplete: function () {
    alert("Thank you for completing the survey!");
  },
  onClose: function () {
    console.log("Survey closed by the user.");
  },
  onOpen: function () {
    console.log("Survey overlay opened.");
  },
  onStart: function () {
    console.log("Survey started.");
  },
});
```

</CodeGroup>

## Troubleshooting

If your event callbacks are not working as expected, here are some common issues to check:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="The callback function is not being executed">
    Ensure that the function is correctly defined and that it is being passed in
    the configuration object of the `initialize` method.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="An error is displayed in the console">
    Check the syntax of your JavaScript code and make sure all required
    parameters are provided correctly.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
